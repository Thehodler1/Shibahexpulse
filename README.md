SEXPLS Whitepaper v0.1
Goal
SEXPLS seeks to become one of the world’s top cryptocurrency meme-tokens. Use Case
SEXPLS is intended to be used as a viable trading currency with the added benefit of rewarding holders in one of the most established meme coins in cryptocurrency - SHIB. SEXPLS also features a variable reward token. This means community members can vote to select which coin the smart contract will pay to holders of SEXPLS.
Strategy
The meme-economy is a well documented phenomenon for economic stimulation.
“Even though millions of consumers encounter and share memes on social media and firms realize its importance (McCrae 2017), consumer research has not yet investigated this phenomenon. We theorize that when encountering a meme, consumers infer that the focal content (e.g., grumpy cat) has become viral. This perception of virality invokes a sense of FOMO for consumers who do not understand the focal content (i.e., fear of missing out; Hayran et al. 2016; Rifkin et al. 2015), which leads to an increased intention to consume.” (Kim 897)
By marketing SEXPLS in the right time and space SEXPLS’s intention is to capture the essence of meme-culture via social networking and organic traffic.
To fund external promotion and any other paid services to help the token, SEXPLS will use a pay by donation marketing wallet. By leveraging a large market cap coin in SHIB as rewards, SEXPLS holders will have the option to use the rewards tax for buying back into the SEXPLS supply or contributing to the SEXPLS LP, further strengthening the token. Given adequate volume, SEXPLS should benefit all token holders due to its cyclic nature.
SEXPLS intends to become a part of internet subculture through community social engagement and fun experiences driven through the website.
Tokenomics
SEXPLS rewards holders in SHIB. SEXPLS token has 100% of it’s supply put into the PancakeSwap exchange. Every exchange-swap buy is taxed 10% to fund a pool for SHIB
rewards. Every exchange-swap sale is taxed 17% to fund a pool for SHIB rewards. Every transaction is taxed 5% to fund liquidity.
Periodically SHIB rewards will be distributed to holders. For a detailed breakdown, see the Dividend Distribution section.
To help mitigate monopoly ownership of the supply, wallet limits have been put into place. No wallet may hold over 1% of the supply.
Dividend Distribution SEXPLS distributes rewards to shareholders. Rewards will be dispersed through a separate dividend distribution contract. Shareholders are defined as any wallet holding SEXPLS. The amount of shares any one wallet has is calculated as 1:1 with SEXPLS tokens. Therefore, 1 SEXPLS Token is equivalent to 1 share.
A share is allotted an amount of dividends. In traditional stock markets, a dividend is a distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders. SEXPLS uses this nomenclature in the same fashion for rewarding holders with SHIB. A dividends value is calculated by using a running total of dividends per share.
The dividends per share increases when a deposit is made into the dividend distributor. Deposits are made into the dividend distributor through a swap back.
A swap back is triggered when a transfer is made and the balance of the contract is above the swap threshold. The contract is funded to meet the swap threshold by taking fees on transfers. These fees are listed as the taxes in the tokenomics section.
When a deposit is made, the amount of reward tokens (SHIB) held inside the dividend distributor are multiplied by a dividends per share accuracy factor and divided by the total shares.
Total shares are calculated as the total amount of tokens owned by unique wallets through transfers inside the SEXPLS contract.
